# ðŸŒ± Crop Recommendation System (Week 1 Submission)

## Problem Statement
Farmers often face difficulties in choosing the right crop due to variations in soil nutrients, pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall. Incorrect crop selection can reduce yield and impact income.

## Objective
To develop a Machine Learning-based system that recommends the most suitable crop for cultivation based on soil and environmental factors.

## Dataset
Dataset Source: [Kaggle - Crop Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset)  
Features:  
- N (Nitrogen), P (Phosphorous), K (Potassium)  
- Temperature, Humidity, pH, Rainfall  
Label: Crop name  

## Background Research
- ML is widely applied in agriculture for yield prediction, disease detection, and crop classification.  
- Crop Recommendation using soil & weather data has proven effective in decision support.  
- Models like Decision Trees and Random Forests perform well for classification tasks.  

## Planned Methodology
1. Collect and preprocess dataset  
2. Apply ML models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)  
3. Evaluate accuracy and compare results  
4. Build simple prediction interface (optional Streamlit app)

## Deliverables (Week 1)
- Problem statement defined  
- Dataset identified and downloaded  
- Literature review completed  
- Clear plan for Week 2 implementation
