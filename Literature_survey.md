# ðŸ“– Literature Survey â€“ Crop Recommendation System

## Introduction
Sustainable agriculture requires data-driven decision-making to optimize crop selection. Farmers often rely on experience and traditional knowledge, which may not always be accurate under changing climate and soil conditions. Machine Learning (ML) provides solutions by analyzing soil nutrients and environmental data.

## Related Work
1. **Crop Yield Prediction using ML**
   - Several studies have applied regression models and decision trees to estimate crop yield based on rainfall, temperature, and soil composition.
   - Reference: "Predicting Crop Yield using Machine Learning Algorithms" (ResearchGate, 2020).

2. **Crop Recommendation Systems**
   - Researchers have developed systems that recommend crops using NPK values, pH, rainfall, and weather data.
   - Common models used: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks.
   - Reference: "Crop Recommendation System Using Machine Learning for Sustainable Agriculture" (IEEE, 2021).

3. **Soil Fertility and ML**
   - Fertilizer recommendation models show how soil nutrients can be optimized for better productivity.
   - Reference: "Fertilizer Recommendation Using Machine Learning Algorithms" (Springer, 2021).

## Key Findings
- Soil nutrients (N, P, K), pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall are the most critical parameters for crop prediction.
- Random Forest and Decision Tree models consistently perform well for classification-based agricultural problems.
- Using clean and well-labeled datasets significantly improves prediction accuracy.

## Conclusion
Based on prior research, developing a Crop Recommendation System using ML is feasible and effective. This project will build upon these findings by applying classification models to predict the most suitable crop, contributing towards sustainable agriculture.
