Project Plan: Crop Recommendation System

Week 1 (Foundation Work):
- Finalize project theme: Sustainable Agriculture
- Define the problem statement and objectives
- Perform literature survey on existing AI/ML solutions in agriculture
- Collect and analyze dataset (Crop Recommendation Dataset from Kaggle)
- Prepare initial project structure and documentation

Week 2 (Implementation Phase):
- Perform data preprocessing (cleaning, scaling, train/test split)
- Train ML models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
- Evaluate performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report
- Compare different models and select the best one

Week 3 (Finalization & Deployment):
- Finalize best-performing model
- Build simple prediction interface (Streamlit/Flask app)
- Test model with sample inputs
- Prepare final project report and presentation
- Submit completed project
